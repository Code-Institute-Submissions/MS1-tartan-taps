# User Experience (UX)

## Strategy

The business is a beer subscription service called Tartan Taps, which has teamed up with some of Scotland's finest craft and micro breweries, to deliver a variety of beers to the customers doorstep. 

In this section I have established user stories which will dictate the website functionality. The aim is to provide information on a selection of quality, great tasting craft beers, alongside their breweries, in order to gain subscribers.

- ### Design
    - #### Colour Scheme
        - The main colours used are Navy and Tan, which has been dictated by the Tartan Taps logo. Tartan will be used in a minimalist way to be in keeping with the company name. 
    - #### Typography
        - Cormorant SC will be used for headings and important information, in keeping with the company logo. Roboto will be utilised for the website content. Sans-serif will be used as a fallback, should there be an error with imported fonts.
