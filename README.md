# User Experience (UX)

## Strategy

The business is a beer subscription service called Tartan Taps, which has teamed up with some of Scotland's finest craft and micro breweries, to deliver a variety of beers to the customers doorstep. 

In this section I have established user stories which will dictate the website functionality. The aim is to provide information on a selection of quality, great tasting craft beers, alongside their breweries, in order to gain subscribers. 

- ### User Stories

        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate through the website intuitively, to seek the information I require. 
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to locate their Social Media accounts, to determine how trusted they are.

        2. As a Frequent User, I want to find information about the breweries, from where the beers came. 
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to cancel / pause my subscription at any point. 
        4. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to change the amount of beers I order each month. 

## Scope

Based on the strategy goals that have been established, I have decided to incorporate a phased approach prioritising the most important information to less feasible concepts. 
This will allow me to manage my workload and build upon any feedback that I receive during the project. 

To begin with the first phase would be to create a minimum viable product (MVP). 

- ### Phase 1:
    - A home page setting out what the website offers. 
    - A beer page showcasing what beers are avaialble. 
    - A breweries page to find out more information about each brewery. 
    - A Customise your crates page. 
    - A contact us page. 

I would then build upon the MVP to further engage the user.   

- ### Phase 2: 
    - Include interactive elements to engage the user (JavaScript knowledge not yet gained)
    - Include a further option that the customer may select their beers individually. 
    - Create a Gift page, to allow users the option of a single purchase or gift subscription. 

I would then implement back end technologies (knowledge not yet gained).

- ### Phase 3:
    - Add a delivery and payments page.



## Structure
- ### Design
    - #### Colour Scheme
        - The main colours used are Navy and Tan, which has been dictated by the Tartan Taps logo. Tartan will be used in a minimalist way to be in keeping with the company name. 
    - #### Typography
        - Cormorant SC will be used for headings and important information, in keeping with the company logo. Roboto will be utilised for the website content. Sans-serif will be used as a fallback, should there be an error with imported fonts. 
    - #### Imagery
        - Utilising bootstraps Jumbotron the home page hero image is designed to catch the user's attention. It has to be contemporary, striking, and directly related to what the company offers.
